# peanut-ui Development Rules

**Version:** 0.0.1 | **Updated:** October 17, 2025

## 🚫 Random

- **Never open SVG files** - it crashes you. Only read jpeg, png, gif, or webp.
- **Never run jq command** - it crashes you.
- **Never run sleep** from command line - it hibernates pc.

## 💻 Code Quality

- **Boy scout rule**: leave code better than you found it.
- **DRY** - do not repeat yourself. Reuse existing code and abstract shared functionality. Less code is better code.
- this also means to use shared consts (e.g. check src/constants)
- **Separate business logic from interface** - this is important for readability, debugging and testability.
- **Use explicit imports** where possible.
- **Reuse existing components and functions** - don't hardcode hacky solutions.
- **Warn about breaking changes** - when making changes, ensure you're not breaking existing functionality, and if there's a risk, explicitly WARN about it.
- **Mention refactor opportunities** - if you notice an opportunity to refactor or improve existing code, mention it. DO NOT make any changes you were not explicitly told to do. Only mention the potential change to the user.
- **Performance is important** - cache where possible, make sure to not make unnecessary re-renders or data fetching.
- **Flag breaking changes** - always flag if changes done in Frontend are breaking and require action on Backend (or viceversa)

## 🚫 Import Rules (critical for build performance)

- **No barrel imports** - never use `import * as X from '@/constants'` or create index.ts barrel files. always import from specific files (e.g. `import { PEANUT_API_URL } from '@/constants/general.consts'`). barrel imports slow down builds and cause bundling issues.
- **No circular dependencies** - before adding imports, check if the target file imports from the current file. circular deps cause `Cannot access X before initialization` errors. move shared types to `interfaces.ts` if needed.
- **No node.js packages in client components** - packages like `web-push`, `fs`, `crypto` (node) can't be used in `'use client'` files. use server actions or api routes instead.
- **Check for legacy code** - before importing from a file, check if it has TODO comments marking it as legacy/deprecated. prefer newer implementations.

## 🧪 Testing

- **Test new code** - where tests make sense, test new code. Especially with fast unit tests.
- **Tests live with code** - tests should live where the code they test is, not in a separate folder
- **Run tests**: `npm test` (fast, ~5s)

## 📁 Documentation

- **All docs go in `docs/`** (except root `README.md`)
- **Keep it concise** - docs should be kept quite concise. AI tends to make verbose logs. No one reads that, keep it short and informational.
- **Check existing docs** before creating new ones - merge instead of duplicate
- **Log significant changes** in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` following semantic versioning
- **Maintain PR.md for PRs** - When working on a PR, maintain a very concise `docs/PR.md` with:
    1. Summary of changes
    2. Risks (what might break)
    3. QA guidelines (what to test)

## 🚀 Performance

- **Cache where possible** - avoid unnecessary re-renders and data fetching
- **Fire simultaneous requests** - if you're doing multiple sequential awaits and they're not interdependent, fire them simultaneously
- **Service Worker cache version** - only bump `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_VERSION` for breaking API changes (see JSDoc in `src/app/sw.ts`). Users auto-migrate.
- **Gate heavy features in dev** - prefetching, precompiling, or eager loading of routes can add 5-10s to dev cold starts. wrap with `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'development'` (e.g. `<link rel="prefetch" href="/qr-pay" />` in layout.tsx).

## 📝 Commits

- **Be descriptive**
- **Use emoji prefixes**: ✨ features, 🐛 fixes, 📚 docs, 🚀 infra, ♻️ refactor, ⚡ performance
