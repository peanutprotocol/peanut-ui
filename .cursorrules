# @dev Add cursor rules here. This goes in the LLM context window on every query when using cursor.

- Use explicit imports where possible
- Make a best effort to keep code quality high. Reuse existing components and functions, dont hardcode hacky solutions.
- When making changes, ensure you're not breaking existing functionality, and if there's a risk, explicitly WARN about it.
- If you notice an opportunity to refactor or improve existing code, mention it.
- Performance is important. Cache where possible, make sure to not make unnecessary re-renders or data fetching.
