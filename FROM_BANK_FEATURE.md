# From Bank Feature - Add Money Flow

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the "From Bank" functionality in the Add Money flow, which allows users to specify an amount they want to add from their bank account.

## Implementation Details

### New Components and Files

1. **AddFlowContext** (`src/context/AddFlowContext.tsx`)
   - Manages state for the add money flow
   - Similar to `WithdrawFlowContext` but for adding money
   - Tracks amount, current view, errors, and bank selection state

2. **Updated Add Money Page** (`src/app/(mobile-ui)/add-money/page.tsx`)
   - Now supports two-step flow:
     - Step 1: Amount input (when "From Bank" is selected)
     - Step 2: Method selection (existing functionality)
   - Uses `TokenAmountInput` component for consistent UI

3. **Updated AddWithdrawRouterView** (`src/components/AddWithdraw/AddWithdrawRouterView.tsx`)
   - Handles "From Bank" button specially
   - Triggers amount input step instead of navigation
   - Includes "From Bank" in both recent methods and all methods views

4. **Updated DepositMethodList** (`src/components/AddMoney/components/DepositMethodList.tsx`)
   - Special handling for "From Bank" method icon
   - Shows bank icon with yellow background

## User Flow

### Current Implementation
1. User navigates to `/add-money`
2. User sees method selection screen with "From Bank" option
3. User clicks "From Bank" button (handled by `AddWithdrawCountriesList.tsx`)
4. **NEW**: Redirects to `/add-money?fromBank=true` and triggers amount input screen
5. **NEW**: Amount input screen appears with `TokenAmountInput`
6. User enters desired amount (minimum $1)
7. User clicks "Continue"
8. **NEW**: Navigates to `/add-money/us/bank` showing bank transfer details
9. User sees transfer summary with next steps information
10. User clicks "Continue Setup" (currently shows placeholder message)

### Current Status
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - The "From Bank" functionality is fully implemented and working.

### Future Enhancement
The "Continue Setup" button currently shows a placeholder alert. The next step would be to:
1. Integrate with KYC flow (similar to withdraw bank form)
2. Create bank account linking functionality
3. Integrate with payment processing backend (ACH transfers)
4. Add real-time status tracking

## Technical Details

### State Management
- `amountToAdd`: Stores the amount user wants to add
- `fromBankSelected`: Boolean flag indicating if user selected "From Bank"
- `currentView`: Tracks which step of the flow user is on
- `error`: Handles validation errors

### Validation
- Minimum amount: $1
- Only accepts valid numbers
- Shows appropriate error messages

### Reused Components
- `TokenAmountInput`: Consistent amount input UI
- `Button`: Standard button component
- `NavHeader`: Navigation header
- `ErrorAlert`: Error display component

## Integration Points

### Context Provider
The `AddFlowContext` is integrated into the main `ContextProvider` to be available throughout the app.

### Method Selection
The "From Bank" method is defined in `UPDATED_DEFAULT_ADD_MONEY_METHODS` and is handled specially in:
- `AddWithdrawCountriesList.tsx`: Sets context state and navigates with URL parameter
- `AddWithdrawRouterView.tsx`: Handles the method in both recent methods and all methods views
- Main add money page: Responds to URL parameter and context state changes

## Next Steps

1. **KYC Integration**: Connect to existing KYC flow for identity verification
2. **Bank Account Linking**: Implement secure bank account connection (similar to withdraw flow)
3. **ACH Integration**: Connect to payment processing API for bank transfers
4. **Success/Error States**: Implement proper transaction status tracking
5. **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for the complete flow
6. **Security**: Add proper validation and fraud prevention measures
