# Peanut — Full Product Description

> Instant global peer-to-peer payments in digital dollars.

## Overview

Peanut is a peer-to-peer payments app that lets users send and receive money globally using digital dollars (USDC stablecoins). It provides a consumer-grade UX on top of blockchain infrastructure — users never need to understand crypto, manage wallets, or handle gas fees.

## Key Features

### Instant P2P Transfers
Send digital dollars to any Peanut user instantly. No waiting for bank processing, no wire fees.

### Payment Links
Generate a shareable link containing funds. The recipient clicks the link to claim the money — no account needed. Links work across messaging apps, email, and social media.

### Bank Cash-Out
Connect a local bank account and convert digital dollars to local currency. Supported rails:
- **Argentina**: Bank transfer, MercadoPago
- **Brazil**: PIX, bank transfer
- **Mexico**: SPEI, bank transfer
- **Colombia**: Bank transfer
- **Peru**: Bank transfer
- **Bolivia**: Bank transfer (via Meru)

### Crypto Deposit
Fund your account by depositing crypto from any exchange (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Bybit, OKX, etc.) or external wallet.

### Card Payments
Physical and virtual debit cards for spending digital dollars at any merchant that accepts card payments.

### QR Payments
Generate and scan QR codes for in-person payments.

## Security Model

- **Self-custodied smart accounts**: User funds sit in ERC-4337 smart accounts, not on Peanut servers
- **Biometric passkeys**: Account access is secured by the device's Secure Enclave (face/fingerprint). The private key never leaves the device
- **No server-side keys**: Peanut cannot access, freeze, or move user funds — even under regulatory pressure
- **Independent recovery**: If Peanut goes offline, users can recover access via any ERC-4337-compatible wallet

## KYC / Compliance

- Core features (send, receive, payment links) work without KYC
- Bank connections trigger a one-time identity check via Persona (SOC2 Type 2, GDPR, ISO 27001)
- Peanut only receives a pass/fail result — no documents stored on Peanut servers
